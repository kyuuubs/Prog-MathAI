## Download CIFAR datasets
1. Go to the CIFAR Dataset Page:
    https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
2. Download the **Python** versions of:
    - Cifar-10
    - Cifar-100 
3. Unzip both archives on your machine.
4. Run ```setup_datasets.py``` in ```/scripts```
5. Move the extracted files into these folders:
    - All Cifar-10 batch files and included ```readme.html``` go into ```dataset/cifar10/```
    - All Cifar-100 files go into ```dataset/cifar100/```
6. Run ```check_datasets.py``` in ```/scripts```
7. The final layout should look like:
    - ```dataset/```
        - ```cifar10/``` (batch files and metadata)
        - ```cifar100/``` (```train```, ```test```, ```meta```, etc.)
